Work has been pretty crazy lately so I've been able to do almost nothing. While I was researching XCB as an option I stumbled upon CMake once again. I've used it before but haven't really done much with it. I looked into it more and discovered that a lot of projects are moving away from AutoTools to CMake. I made a branch to give it a try and all I can say is wow. It's a ton easier to use and you get more features. I don't need a makefile in every single directory and the syntax is much easier. I'm definitely glad I switched over to it. I even managed to get rid of some of the weird build problems I was having when I was testing what I had in my virtual machine. I'm really glad I switched.
