![My First Window!]({{ site.url }}/simplicity/assets/first_window.png)

I have finally gotten my first window to draw! I don't even remember the last time I was this excited to see a white rectangle. I decided to try and do something to show that I was really getting things done and I figured drawing a window on the screen would be a great way to do it. Put things in perspective and all. I got it rendering finally! Now I feel like I can do some more interesting things.
