The basic goal for this project is two fold. One is to write some C/C++ code. I almost never get to write any C style code anymore. I'm almost always writing in Python, Perl, Java, and Javascript. These langauges are great and all but I first really learned to program in C and C++. This is a good opportunity to write some real C code! :) The other goal is to write THE window manager that I just love. I've tried a fair few different options already and while some are pretty great I just like the idea of having the one that was literally made for me. I've never done anything like this so it'll definitely be a big challenge and there's a lot for me to learn.

My plan for development is to do things in little steps. I'm hoping that I can do frequent mini updates to keep things going and to prevent myself from getting stuck doing a really big project and find its got a fatal flaw at the very end.

I spent a bunch of time already working on the basic build system. I decided to go with the AutoConf toolchain. AutoConf wasn't the most pleasant to get setup but that's done. Now I'm actually writing some code!
