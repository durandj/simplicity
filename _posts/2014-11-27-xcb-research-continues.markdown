I've been doing more research on switching to XCB and so far it seems like a great idea. XCB is a much smaller dependency but it will most likely require a bit more work to get running. My hope, though, is that it will address my concern about having to have GNOME or KDE on the system. I'm making progress but I don't want to merge what I have so far into the main branch until after I have it working at the same level that the GNOME stuff is. The problem I'm having right now is connecting to the X server. I'm sure once I get passed that which is probably a silly error it'll be fine.
