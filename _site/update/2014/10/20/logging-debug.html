  <article class="post-content">
    <p>I’ve been working on getting logging added since that will definitely help with tracking down issues and makeing sure all goes as it should. Since I’m already using Boost I decided to go with Boost.Log. It took a bit of work to get setup since I’m still new to using the AutoConf toolchain with Boost and I’m a bit rusty with C++ but in the end I got it. It does some really basic logging. My next goal is to make logging a bit easier to use since I’ll be more inclined to log things if I don’t have to jump through hoops to do it. Currently logging looks something like this:</p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;boost/log/core.hpp&gt;

#include "main.h"

void log_something(void)
{
	BOOST_LOG_SEV(get_global_logger(), boost::log::trivial::debug) &lt;&lt; "Yay!";
}
</code></pre>

<p>I ommitted a bit more code but that’s the general idea. That’s not very friendly. I want to make this a bit easier to do so I’m going to add some helper functions so that you can just do this:</p>

<pre><code>log_debug() &lt;&lt; "Yay!";
</code></pre>

<p>That’s what I’m looking at for now. I would like to make things even better but I need to do some testing first and I want to keep my one step at a time approach.</p>

<p>I also need to do some work on the blog. I want to theme it at some point and it really needs some tools to make generating posts a bit easier. I’ll do some work on that when I need a break.</p>
